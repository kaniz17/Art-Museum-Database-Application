# Art-Museum-Database-Application

This project revolves around the development of an application tailored for an art museum, which serves as a comprehensive solution for managing their art objects database. The primary objective is to create an interface that seamlessly interacts with a meticulously designed and implemented SQL database. This database stores crucial information about the museum's art collection, enabling efficient data entry, maintenance, and information retrieval.
